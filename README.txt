The file required to run is a json file follows this structure:

[
  {
    "url": "/path/"
  },
  {
    "url": "/relativepath/",
    "run_browser": true,
    "regex": ["[-+]?[0-9]*\\.[0-9]+"]
  },
  {
    "url": "/relativepath/",
    "compare_url": "https://mydomain.com/absolutepath/",
    "fuzzy": 1.0,
    "run_browser": true
  }
]

Each item of the array of the json is required to contain a url
property, this url can use a relative or absolute path, if itâ€™s a
relative the domain will be mounted based on the server, your username
and role.
Every other attribute is optional.

Optional attributes

status_codes: An array of status codes expected retrieving the url (default to 200)

compare_url: Url to compare the html output with, this one must be in absolute path format.

fuzzy: How different can both urls be? 1 for not different at all, 0 for completely different (default to 1).

follow_links: Indicates whether it should follow the links in the page to look for 404 or 500 errors (default to false).

follow_links_fast: Indicates whether it should follow the links in the page to look for 404 or 500 errors, it should be a float number to indicate how different the urls can be (similar to fuzzy option), it compares only the relative url, not the domain or the parameters (default to false).

run_browser: Indicates whether it should open a real browser tab with the url (default to false).

regex: An array of regular expressions to test against the html output (to match)

not_regex: An array of regular expressions to test against the html output (to not match)
