Additional switches depend on the set of plugins currently available.

The file required to run is a json file follows this structure:

[
  {
    "url": "/path/"
  },
  {
    "url": "/relativepath/",
    "run_browser": true,
    "regex": ["[-+]?[0-9]*\\.[0-9]+"]
  },
  {
    "url": "/relativepath/",
    "compare_url": "https://mydomain.com/absolutepath/",
    "fuzzy": 1.0,
    "run_browser": true
  }
]

Each item of the array of the json is required to contain a url
property, this url can use a relative or absolute path, if itâ€™s a
relative the domain will be mounted based on the server, your username
and role.
Every other attribute is optional and depends on the plugins available.
